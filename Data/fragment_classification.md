# Basic structure of molecule

Each molecule is composed of six fragments.  They are a modifier group, Benzothiazole ring, an Amide group, an Aryl group, and two ethers.

I classified fragments into six based on bioisoster.

Modifier group is usually a halogen, but may also be a hydrocarbon group.

Benzothiaole ring may be only F4.

Amide group are the fragments with primary, secondary, or tertiary amide.

Aryl groups are benzene or similar, like thiophene, pyridine, and so on.

Ethers are ethers or equivalent, like sulfur, dinitrile, and so on.
