# Basic structure of molecule

Each molecule is composed of six fragments.  They are a modifier group, Benzothiazole ring, an Amide group, an Aryl group, and two ethers.

I classified fragments into six based on bioisoster.

## Modifier group
Modifier group is usually a halogen, but may also be a hydrocarbon group.

## Benzothiazole group
Fragment including Benzothiazole part.

## Amide group
Amide group are the fragments with primary, secondary, or tertiary amide.

## Aryl group
Aryl groups are benzene or similar, like thiophene or  pyridine.

## Alcohol group
Alcohol are alcohol or bioisoster of them, like amine.
