# Basic structure of molecule

Each molecule is composed of six fragments.  They are a modifier group, Benzothiazole ring, an Amide group, an Aryl group, and two ethers.

I classified fragments into six based on bioisoster.

## Modifier group
Modifier group is usually a halogen, but may also be a hydrocarbon group.

## Benzothiazole group
Fragment including Benzothiazole part.

### Note: Each F15 and F57 is Benzothiazole but there are no binding sites for Modifier.

## Amide group
Amide group are the fragments with primary, secondary, or tertiary amide.

## Aryl group
Aryl groups are benzene or similar, like thiophene or  pyridine.

### Note: Each of F55 and F56 is in the form of a benzen ring bonded to a ring structure with an oxygen attached, and there are no binding sites for alcohol.

## Alcohol group
Alcohol are alcohol or bioisoster of them, like amine.

## Others
Molecules that were not considered to belong to any of these groups above are classified as Others. 
If necessary, you can use these fragments after create binding.dat and edit fragment_classification.dat.
